# Employee_Manager


Hello and Welcome! 

I'm thrilled to introduce you to my inaugural Full Stack project. In this endeavor, I've harnessed the power of JavaScript, React, and Bootstrap on the frontend, while on the backend, I've seamlessly integrated Java, Spring Web, Spring Security, and PostgreSQL as our trusty database.

This journey spanned approximately 6 weeks, commencing with my exploration of Spring Boot's fundamentals. With each passing week, I embarked on a voyage of discovery, continuously enriching this project with newfound wisdom and insights.

If you're eager to explore my creation, follow this step-by-step guide:

1. **Clone the Repository**

2. **Open the Frontend and Backend in Your Preferred IDE**

3. **Execute 'npm i'** to install the requisite packages in the frontend folder.

4. **Launch 'npm run dev'** to set the frontend in motion.

5. **Run the 'EmployeeManagerApplication' class** on the backend.
